# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

To create a GitHub repository for this project and push the code, follow these steps:

1. Go to GitHub.com and log in to your account
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Enter 'junie-demo' as the repository name
4. Choose whether to make it public or private
5. Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (as the project already exists)
6. Click 'Create repository'
7. GitHub will show commands to push an existing repository. Use the following commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/junie-demo.git
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
git push -u origin main
```

Replace 'YOUR-USERNAME' with your actual GitHub username.
