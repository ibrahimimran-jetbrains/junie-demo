# GitHub Repository Setup - Final Steps

## What Has Been Done
1. Confirmed the project name is "junie-demo"
2. Verified Git is already initialized in the project
3. Checked that no remote repositories are configured
4. Created detailed instructions in `github_instructions.md`
5. Staged all files in the project
6. Committed all changes with the message "Prepare project for GitHub repository"

## What You Need to Do
To complete the GitHub repository setup, follow the instructions in the `github_instructions.md` file:

1. Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository named "junie-demo"
2. Run the following commands in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/junie-demo.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   (Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

Once these steps are completed, your project will be successfully pushed to GitHub and accessible at:
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/junie-demo

You can then share this URL with others or use it for deployment, collaboration, or other purposes.
